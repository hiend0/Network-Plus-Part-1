## Reflection Questions

### 1. What did you do in this lab?
_Describe the steps you took and the tasks you completed._

At the start I got to take a look into packet tracer and set up my topology. Where I connected the console cable from the PC to the switch. From there I used plenty of command line prompt to help configure the clock commands.

### 2. What did you learn?
_Explain the concepts or skills you gained from this lab._
I learned what will be prompt if I put in the wrong commands. With IOS providing different outputs for incorrect or incomplete commands. The use of "?" is really helpful when you need a list of commands. This was very helpful through out the lab. 

### 3. What did you struggle with or not fully understand?
_Identify any parts of the lab that were confusing or challenging._

Overall this lab was simple enough to follow. I didn't have many confusion or challenges.

### 4. What suggestions do you have to improve this lab experience?
_Offer feedback on how the lab could be clearer, more engaging, or better supported._

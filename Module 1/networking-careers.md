# Networking Careers in the Cloud and AI Era
***

## Welcome to Network+ Part 1

To kick off our journey into the world of networking, let's explore how the field has evolved and where it's headed. This assignment will help you get a feel for the kinds of jobs available today, how networks are built and managed, and how cloud computing and AI are reshaping the landscape.

## Your Task

Use Google or another search engine to explore the following questions. Take notes and write a short summary of what you discover.

### Research Questions

1. **What kinds of networking jobs exist today?**  
   Look into roles like network administrator, cloud network engineer, and data center technician. What do these jobs involve?
   
   There are more networking jobs beyond just routers and switches now a days. A network administrator focuses on managing an internal network. A network administrator sets up, configures, and maintains LANs, WANs, and the internet. Other jobs include Network Security Engineer who specialize in firewalls, intrusion detection, and securing traffic.

2. **How has the rise of cloud computing changed networking careers?**  
   Explore how companies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have centralized many networking functions.

   With the rise of cloud computing, it reshaped networking careers in a different way. Because providers like AWS, Azure, and Google cloud now centralized a lot of the functions that used to require racks of hardware. Before the cloud networking professionals designed and maintained physical routers, firewalls and load balancers.  

3. **Why are smaller organizations using hybrid cloud networks?**  
   Investigate how businesses combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services, and what challenges they face.

   Smaller organizations are using hybrid cloud networks because the networks offer a middle ground between cloud computing's flexibility as well as on-premises infrastructure's control. Hybrid cloud networks can be challenging because of their complexity since they manage two environments (on-prem and cloud). Security risks of misconfigurations in VPNs or cloud storage can expose data.  

4. **How do laws and regulations affect how networks are built?**  
   Search for examples of compliance requirements (like HIPAA or GDPR) that influence network design.
   
   Laws as well as regulations do impact the way networks are built. These laws and the regulations dictate requirements for the data security and the data privacy and the data handling.

5. **What impact is AI having on networking?**  
   Find out how automation, machine learning, and AI tools are changing how networks are monitored and managed.

   AI and machine learning are changing network monitoring and management by introducing automation, predictive capabilities, and enhanced security. AI-powered tools automate routine tasks, analyzing network data in real-time, also enabling proactive issue resolution. This will lead to improved security, improved network performance, and increased efficiency.

  #  Reflective Questions
**What did you do?**

**What did you learn?**

**What did you struggle with or not fully understand?**

**How could this lab experience have been improved for you?**

For this lab I had to research different jobs within networking, how networks are built as well as managed, plus how AI and cloud computing are reshaping the landscape. I've realized there are many different career paths in networking, especially with the growth of AI and cloud computing. Overall, the lab was very informative, and it gave me a new look into more networking jobs and the growth of AI and cloud computing.
